        <h1>My Ideal Job</h1>
        <h3 style="text-align:center;">7XD is offering a position for a VR/AR Programmer. If only I were ready...</h3>

        <p>As we begin a new hobby or take on a new course, it is important to establish goals. Goals are important to direct our focus and to re establish our commitment when motivation wanes. In an effort to guide to my studies, I have identified an ideal job that motivates me and gives me a goal to work towards. 7DX Pty Ltd is an organisation based in New South Wales that specialises in developing innovative Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality solutions across multiple areas such as training, simulation, and entertainment. They service a range of sectors including education, mining, and transport. They have recently released a job vacancy advertising a position for a VR/AR Programmer. The successful candidate would gain sought after and exciting exposure to the fast-moving world that is Augmented and Virtual Reality. I can see this technology making my workplace much more efficient in the future. I can see it providing surreal simulation that is both entertaining and highly useful in training and education. I want to help shape a world that gives everyone access to education and I firmly believe that AR and VR will provide an interactive experience like no other.</p>
        <h4>So what are they after and why aren't I ready?</h4>
        <p>7XD is looking for an individual who has existing experience in Programming and Development. The position specifically asks for somebody experienced in UE4 Dev, PC VR Dev, Mobile VR Dev, Mobile AR Dev and experience with source control software such as Git. They want a team player who communicates well. Communication is important in collaboration particularly because the Dev team at 7XD will be working remote from each other. The individual they are seeking needs to be a problem solver that can take the initiative and work intuitively alone. They should not be uncomfortable asking for help; however, they should not rely on others to do their work for them. The individual needs to be creative and ambitious, entering the role with a determination to make a difference.</p>
        <p>I do not have the technical experience that 7XD is looking for in this advertisement. However, I am committed to learning the programming and development skills they require so that when another position like this arises, I am ready to be employed. Even though I do not have the technical skills, I do possess many of the human characteristics that 7XD is looking for. I can take initiative and make a start where I see an opportunity. I find satisfaction in solving problems, such that it led me to pursue a technical trade qualification. I can also ask for help after several failed attempts. I can often identify when is best to take the lead and when is best to allow others to lead. I am very much ambitious, wanting to learn about everything, talk to everyone and make positive change where I can.</p>
        <h4>I have time!</h4>
        <p>Even though I claim to possess many of the human characteristics required by 7XD for this position, I know I can develop these skills significantly. Considering it will be a few years before I have the technical skills and experience required, I can use this time to continue improving my social intelligence, self-awareness, and leadership qualities. There are multitudes of books, podcasts and YouTube content to help me develop. However, nothing beats putting myself into real life positions that allow me to interact with other individuals and teams, and situations that force me to expand my comfort zone.<br> I am also committed to acquiring the necessary technical skills, and plan to do this through several means. To begin with, I will select electives at RMIT in Programming, AR/VR and Software Development to help guide my pathway. I will continue to undertake courses through providers such as W3Schools, LinkedIn Learning and FreeCodeCamp. As a supplement to these foundational learning techniques, I will continue to read articles, listen to podcasts, and watch YouTube videos on the topic. I look forward to the journey and cannot imagine what I will learn along the way.</p>
