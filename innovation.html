            <h1>Remote Guided Maintenance</h1>
                <h4><em>Does your organisation own a large fleet of vehicles that operate throughout Australia?</em></h4>  
                <h4><em>Do you want to save thousands of dollars in call-out fees when your vehicles break down?</em></h4>
                    <p>I would like to develop an application that can be installed onto the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwOnHqiNAeU">Microsoft HoloLens</a> or other Augmented Reality (AR) platform. The application will give vehicle drivers access to all the important information necessary to maintain their vehicle, including tabulated data, operating instructions, troubleshooting and diagnosis guides. The technology will also function as a live video transmitter between the driver and a remote mechanic. The device with this application will save drivers hours of time waiting on the side of the road for a mechanic and will save the fleet owners thousands in break down call-out fees imposed by mobile mechanics.</p>
