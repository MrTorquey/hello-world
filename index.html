        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <h2>By: <em>John Smith</em></h2>
        <p>I am a 24-year-old guy from Tasmania, currently living in Sydney and studying IT at RMIT.</p>
        <p>I am very much a product of the environments I grew up in – living on a rural agricultural property, to a relaxed beach block to, unforgettably, a residence in South East Asia for several months. I’m not a city boy, but at 17 years old I moved out of home into the new and unfamiliar environment of Melbourne to pursue a Certificate IV in Circus Arts at the National Institute of Circus Arts – an absolutely amazing opportunity. Twelve months later, however, I secured an apprenticeship with a large organisation through which I successfully completed my Certificate III in Heavy Diesel Automotive Mechanics, leading to my current occupation. As I work, I see the proliferation of emerging technologies and see opportunities to enhance my workplace all the time – if only implementing change was straightforward!</p>
        <p>Before I leave you to explore my page, I’ll give you a summary of my hobbies to help shape your perception of me: I love to get outdoors, to take calculated risks, and to challenge myself and others. My favourite ways to achieve all these things together is to go rock climbing, trail running and deep-sea kayaking. I also like to spend my Sunday evenings at church, to catch movies at the cinema and to learn new things all the time (anything – can you teach me something?) I’m keen to hear from you; feel free to contact me at my email – s3879428@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
