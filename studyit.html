        <h1>My Interest In IT</h1>
            <h4>History</h4>
            <p>My interest in IT does not actually have a long history. Had you told me 12 months ago that I would be undertaking study in IT, I would have said “You’re crazy”. But here I am and very excited. Since 2010 I have had a MacBook. It had gotten so slow that I would only use it when absolutely necessary. When the COVID pandemic began, my girlfriend told me about MOOC’s, they sounded great. One week later I had a new laptop and my interest in IT began to develop with access to so much great free content online. I was learning about these phenomenal concepts such as quantum computing, blockchain, machine learning, IoT and AI. I now see so much potential in my own workplace and the world and want to effect change.</p>
            <h4>A degree or MOOC's?</h4>
            <p>What better way to effect change than with a degree from one of Australia’s top universities - RMIT? Online courses are fantastic, but what they do not provide are classmates to bounce ideas off, a tutor to ask for help and access to many scholarly resources. With technology advancing at an exponential rate, having a bachelor of IT will be just a start in keeping up with it, but it will also be sure to increase my employability. Having the flexibility to work anywhere in the world from my own home and being able to work at home from anywhere in the world is a very appealing and exciting prospect.</p>
            <h4>Uni, but not only uni..</h4>
            <p>I believe that RMIT will broaden my knowledge and understanding of IT systems, both those already in existence and those emerging. I do not expect RMIT to morph me into an IT expert, realising that theoretical knowledge is only one aspect to the learning cycle. However, I can use my studies to prepare me for what I may encounter in the workplace, and as a platform from which I can develop hands-on skills, interpersonal and communication skills, and industry relationships. I expect to improve my awareness of ethical dilemmas that will be sure to challenge my decision making in this field. It will also help me to identify the range of potential jobs in the IT field, and which ones I might be best suited to.</p>
