        <h1>Personal Profile</h1>
            <p>Who we are and the way we learn and work are important indictors of career success. An individual can be an expert at a particular skill, but the value they contribute will be diminished if they cannot conduct themselves appropriately and respectfully in a team. ‘Emergence’ is a term used to describe an affect where the outcome is greater than the sum of the parts, such as is seen when a team combines their individual good ideas to produce amazing results. Active participation, open communication, humble leadership, and routine reflection are often very difficult to achieve in diverse groups but are well worth the effort. Sometimes the most important thing we can bring to a team is a self-awareness of how we perform in a team and what we need to be successful. Considering this, I have undertaken three online tests to firstly, help me understand myself better and secondly, to help potential future employers get to know and decide whether I will suit their team.</p>

    <h3>Learning Style by PersonalityMax</h3>
        <p>Go <a href="https://personalitymax.com/report/?ls=56-74-64">here</a> to see my full learning styles report.</p>
        <p>Primary learning style: <em>Auditory – 38%</em> <br>
            Secondary learning style: <em>Kinaesthetic – 33%</em> <br>
            Tertiary learning style: <em>Visual – 29%</em> </p>
            <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Good at remembering and recalling spoken information </li>
                <li>Able to comprehend information without missing much </li>
                <li>Often skilled at speaking  </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Weaknesses</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Easily distracted by sounds </li>
                <li>Not as skilled at putting information into diagrams and flow charts </li>
                <li>May miss visual details that others observe </li>
            </ul>
                <p>Analysis on the results from these three tests has been quite insightful. There are many traits that are relatable and hard to deny. For example, I often take other people’s problems and make them my own, feeling disheartened when the other fails to succeed. I tend to enjoy podcasts much better than YouTube videos as I often find the animations and footage distracting. There were also a number of traits that I do not resonate with. I do not generally have difficulty committing to objectives when managed by force and I tend to disagree that I am able to reach others’ minds using raw emotion. However, this observation could simply be my own biased opinion. It would be beneficial and indeed interesting if at least three other people could provide feedback on my personality, social persona and learning styles in order that I might make a more discerning and well-rounded judgement.</p>
                <p>As a result of these tests I now have a greater awareness of myself. This enhanced awareness will undoubtedly lead me to perform and behave better as part of any team that I participate with in the future. Understanding that I function as a ‘Protagonist’ will encourage me to attempt to diffuse disputes using good interpersonal skills. I must also be very aware of my altruistic trait and that I must not allow other people’s problems to become my own. My Amiable Social Persona is a reminder that I can be very supportive when necessary and so I should be aware of other group members losing motivation or becoming overwhelmed. Knowing that I am predominantly an Auditory Learner, I must be aware that others may not process my spoken word the same way that I understand what others say in a conversation or team discussion. I must also be aware that I may miss visual details that others observe.</p>
                <p>In forming a team, I should seek to find a diversity of personality types and social types. Having others with qualities that balance out mine would be beneficial in approaching project work from different angles. Of particular benefit would be to have at least one other person who is predominantly a visual learner to balance my auditory learning style. Having a good decision maker may be of benefit in balancing out the ‘Protagonist’ weakness regarding difficulty in making decisions that have no obviously correct answers. Having a group with personality traits that are too diverse may lead to tension, but it can no doubt work with clear stated goals and regular communication between the team. I should attempt to get to know people and how they communicate, and I should make them aware of my ambitious motivation so that they are prepared for my encouragement to always strive for excellence.</p>
